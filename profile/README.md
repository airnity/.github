## Flattening the word

We aim at facilitating and simplifying connectivity for the connected car industry, ensuring harmonized global access to cellular connectivity in a secured and uniform way.

We build a Full-MVNO dedicated to the connected car Connectivity 2.0.

Airnity addresses local technical, operational, and regulatory constraints.

## We are changing the connected car connectivity paradigm…

Car makers are transforming the automobile into a complex software platform. The Airnity team is driven by the belief that the automotive embedded connectivity requires a change of paradigm.

Current solutions haven't been designed for cars – Airnity defines a new and dedicated connectivity solution and offering for Connected Cars where connectivity challenges such as cost, regulation, logistics, differences between MNO are fully abstracted, hence simplified from a Connected Car design perspective.

While providing an homogeneous setup globally, Airnity's connectivity will always be the best connectivity available locally.
